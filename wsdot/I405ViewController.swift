		"Toll rates will adjust between 75 cents and $10 based on traffic volumes in the express " +
		"toll lane. Drivers will pay the rate they see upon entering the lanes, even if they see " +
		"a higher price down the road. Transit, vanpools, carpools and motorcycles can use the " +
		"lanes for free with a <em>Good To Go!</em> account and pass. The lanes are open to all " +
        "vehicles toll-free Monday-Friday 7 p.m.-5 a.m., on weekends, and on New Years Day, Memorial Day, " +
        "Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.</p>" +

		"enter express toll lanes at designated access points that are marked with dashed lines. " +
		"Just remember that failure to use designated access points will result in a $136 ticket " +
		"for crossing the double white lines.</p>" +
		"<p>There are two direct access ramps to I-405 express toll lanes that allow you to " +
		"directly enter the express toll lanes from the middle of the freeway. These ramps are at " +
		"Northeast 6th Street in Bellevue and Northeast 128th Street in Kirkland.</p>" +
        
		"<p><strong>Using the lanes</strong><br />" +
		"Any existing <em>Good To Go!</em> pass can be used to pay a toll.</p>" +
		"<p>If you carpool on the I-405 express toll lanes, you must meet the occupancy requirements " +
		"and have a <em>Good To Go!</em> account and Flex Pass set to HOV mode to travel toll-free. Carpool " +
		"requirements are three occupants during weekday peak hours (5-9 a.m. and 3-7 p.m.) and two " +
		"occupants during off-peak hours (9 a.m.-3 p.m.).</p>" +
		"<p>If a driver does not have a <em>Good To Go!</em> account, a Pay By Mail toll bill will be mailed " +
		"to the vehicleâ€™s registered owner for an additional $2 per toll transaction.</p>" +
